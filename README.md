# hollywood-squares
#### backend
express server, mongo atlas db, port running 8080, ws open

#### frontend
react, no style, fetch

#### idea
frontend creates lobbies, game is between 2 players. hollywood squares plays out. need a list of questions + answers + meme answers. square gives answer, player guesses if its true or meme. then its naughts and crosses as usual.

#### currently
currently is only in browser. once its working as intended both front and back it'll get ported to WPF so i can practice.
